//Ok so You completed the First Code then  here is a little print in java

public class Print{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.print("I Like MoMo");
    System.out.print("Its Good");
    //If you run this you will see that the print are in the same line oh no what to do so for that we will use println 
    //The Println Statement creates A line after the execution of that Statement remember after not before
    System.out.println("I like MoMo");
    System.out.println("Its Good");
    //Did i use println in the first code. I forgot but think i used print no println
    //Ok lets also learn about \n 
    System.out.println("So \n is used to give a new line exactly where its executed \n like here its a new line.");
