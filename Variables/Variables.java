    //Simply its a Variable where simple values directly stored in memory
    //And Reference well its hard to explain, It stored values in address like memory address. You will understand as we go on.
    //So what is in Primitive Datatype 
    //-int 
    //-double
    //-char
    //-boolean
    // and other types of double and integer like byte float short long which i will explain don't worry
    // And Reference Variables are String Objects Arrays etc;
